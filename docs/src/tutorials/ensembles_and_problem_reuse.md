# [Ensembles, `remake`, and problem reuse](@id ensembles_problem_reuse)

Stochastic simulations are usually run many times, so it is worth knowing how to reuse
a `JumpProblem` efficiently and how to run simulations in parallel safely. This tutorial
explains the rules that JumpProcesses follows and shows patterns that balance
performance and safety.

The key fact: a [`JumpProblem`](@ref) stores **mutable jump state**, namely the jump
aggregator and its callbacks. Solvers owned by JumpProcesses ([`SSAStepper`](@ref)
and the ODE/DAE pathways) reuse this state directly and re-initialize it at the start
of every solve. They never copy it. This makes repeated solves fast, but it means that
**one `JumpProblem` supports one active solve or integrator at a time**:

  - Repeated serial solves of one problem are safe and fast.
  - Concurrent solves, from threads or tasks, need independent copies of the problem.
  - Problems created with `remake` share the original's jump state.
  - `EnsembleProblem`s create the copies they need for you.

We use a simple birth-death process, ``\emptyset \to X`` at rate ``p_1`` and
``X \to \emptyset`` at rate ``p_2 X``, throughout:

```@example reuse
using JumpProcesses, SciMLBase

maj = MassActionJump([[0 => 1], [1 => 1]], [[1 => 1], [1 => -1]]; param_idxs = [1, 2])
dprob = DiscreteProblem([10], (0.0, 100.0), [1.0, 0.1])
# only save the initial and final states
jprob = JumpProblem(dprob, Direct(), maj; save_positions = (false, false))
nothing # hide
```

## Repeated serial solves

Solving the same problem repeatedly in a loop is the fastest way to generate many
samples: each solve re-initializes the problem's jump state from the problem's
current initial condition and parameters, so nothing needs to be copied or rebuilt.

```@example reuse
final_counts = [solve(jprob, SSAStepper(); seed).u[end][1] for seed in 1:1000]
sum(final_counts) / length(final_counts)
```

## Parameter sweeps with `remake`

`remake` creates a problem with a new initial condition, parameters, or time span.
The new problem **shares** the original's jump state rather than copying it, which
makes `remake` cheap:

```@example reuse
remade = remake(jprob; p = [2.0, 0.1])
remade.discrete_jump_aggregation === jprob.discrete_jump_aggregation
```

Since every solve re-initializes the shared state from the problem being solved, remade
problems can be solved one after another:

```@example reuse
mean_counts = map([0.5, 1.0, 2.0]) do birth_rate
    prob = remake(jprob; p = [birth_rate, 0.1])
    sum(solve(prob, SSAStepper(); seed).u[end][1] for seed in 1:500) / 500
end
```

However, the original and remade problems must not be solved concurrently, and must
not be used for integrators that are alive at the same time. Use `deepcopy` when you
need an independent problem.

## Ensembles

An [`EnsembleProblem`](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/features/ensemble/)
handles the copying needed to run trajectories safely:

  - `EnsembleSerial()` with `safetycopy = false` (the default when no `prob_func` is
    given) reuses the problem sequentially and makes no copies.
  - `EnsembleThreads()` with `safetycopy = false` copies the problem once per spawned
    task, and each task reuses its copy for its trajectories. With one thread, or a
    batch of one trajectory, it falls back to the serial path and uses the original
    problem.
  - With `safetycopy = true` (the default when a `prob_func` is given), every
    trajectory solves its own copy, made **before** `prob_func` is called.

```@example reuse
ensemble = EnsembleProblem(jprob)
esol = solve(ensemble, SSAStepper(), EnsembleThreads(); trajectories = 1000, seed = 1)
length(esol.u)  # the trajectories
```

### Custom `prob_func`s

A `prob_func` lets each trajectory use a different problem. A `prob_func` that only
modifies the problem it is given, for example with `remake`, is safe without safety
copies, because with `EnsembleThreads()` the problem it is given is already the copy
owned by the current task. Turning off the safety copies then avoids one copy per
trajectory:

```@example reuse
prob_func(prob, ctx) = remake(prob; p = [0.5 + 0.001 * ctx.sim_id, 0.1])
with_copies = EnsembleProblem(jprob; prob_func)  # safetycopy = true by default
without_copies = EnsembleProblem(jprob; prob_func, safetycopy = false)

function run_ensemble(ensemble)
    solve(ensemble, SSAStepper(), EnsembleThreads();
        trajectories = 2000)
end
run_ensemble(with_copies), run_ensemble(without_copies)  # compile before timing
(; with_copies = @elapsed(run_ensemble(with_copies)),
    without_copies = @elapsed(run_ensemble(without_copies)))
```

A `prob_func` must only derive its result from the problem it receives. Returning
some other, shared problem defeats the ensemble's copies:

```julia
# Unsafe with EnsembleThreads: uses the global `jprob`, not the task's copy `prob`
bad_prob_func(prob, ctx) = remake(jprob; p = [0.5 + 0.001 * ctx.sim_id, 0.1])
```

### Stateful callbacks

Callbacks passed as keyword arguments to `solve` are shared by every trajectory of an
ensemble, since ensembles copy only the problem. A callback that stores its own mutable
state should instead be passed to the `JumpProblem`, so that the ensemble's problem
copies include it, and should reset its state in its `initialize` function, so that
reusing it for the next trajectory starts fresh. For example, a callback that stops a
simulation after a given number of jumps:

```@example reuse
function stop_after_jumps(n)
    njumps = Ref(0)  # callback state
    reset!(cb, u, t, integrator) = (njumps[] = 0)
    function affect!(integrator)
        njumps[] += 1
        njumps[] >= n && terminate!(integrator)
    end
    DiscreteCallback((u, t, integrator) -> true, affect!; initialize = reset!)
end

birth = MassActionJump([[0 => 1]], [[1 => 1]]; param_idxs = [1])
birth_prob = DiscreteProblem([0], (0.0, 100.0), [1.0])
counting_jprob = JumpProblem(birth_prob, Direct(), birth; callback = stop_after_jumps(5))
esol = solve(EnsembleProblem(counting_jprob), SSAStepper(), EnsembleThreads();
    trajectories = 100)
all(sol.u[end] == [5] for sol in esol.u)
```

Passing `callback = stop_after_jumps(5)` to `solve` instead would share one counter
between all threads.

## Manual threading

When launching tasks yourself, give each task its own copy of the problem, made once
per task and reused for all of that task's solves:

```@example reuse
nsims = 1000
chunks = Iterators.partition(1:nsims, cld(nsims, Threads.nthreads()))
tasks = map(chunks) do seeds
    Threads.@spawn begin
        local_prob = deepcopy(jprob)  # one independent copy per task
        [solve(local_prob, SSAStepper(); seed).u[end][1] for seed in seeds]
    end
end
final_counts = reduce(vcat, fetch.(tasks))
length(final_counts)
```

Never solve one problem, or problems created from it with `remake`, from several tasks
at the same time. For the same reason, integrators that are alive at the same time need
independent problems:

```@example reuse
integrator1 = init(deepcopy(jprob), SSAStepper(); seed = 1)
integrator2 = init(deepcopy(jprob), SSAStepper(); seed = 2)
step!(integrator1)
step!(integrator2)
integrator1.t, integrator2.t
```

## Distributed ensembles

`EnsembleDistributed()` sends the problem to each worker. With `safetycopy = false` and
`pmap_batch_size > 1`, which is the default for 200 or more trajectories, a worker may
run several trajectories as concurrent tasks that share its copy of the problem. To be
safe, use `safetycopy = true` or `pmap_batch_size = 1`:

```julia
using Distributed
esol = solve(EnsembleProblem(jprob; safetycopy = true), SSAStepper(),
    EnsembleDistributed(); trajectories = 10_000)
```

## Aliasing `SSAStepper` inputs

Independently of the jump state, `SSAStepper` supports the common SciML `alias` keyword
argument for its `u0`, `p`, and `tstops` inputs. By default it copies `u0`, reuses `p`,
and never modifies a `tstops` array you pass. For example, a callback that modifies
parameters changes the problem's own parameter vector by default. Passing
`alias_p = false` gives the solve its own copy:

```@example reuse
stop_births = DiscreteCallback((u, t, integrator) -> t == 50.0,
    function (integrator)
        integrator.p[1] = 0.0
        reset_aggregated_jumps!(integrator)
    end)
sol = solve(jprob, SSAStepper(); callback = stop_births, tstops = [50.0],
    alias = SciMLBase.DiscreteAliasSpecifier(alias_p = false))
jprob.prob.p
```

Permitting `u0` to be aliased avoids a copy, but the solve then mutates the problem's
`u0`, so the next solve starts from the final state of the previous one:

```@example reuse
prob_u0 = deepcopy(jprob)
solve(prob_u0, SSAStepper(); seed = 1, alias = SciMLBase.DiscreteAliasSpecifier(alias_u0 = true))
prob_u0.prob.u0
```

Use an `ODEAliasSpecifier` to also control `tstops`. `alias` never controls the jump
state; even `alias = false` reuses the problem's jump aggregator.

## SDE and RODE problems

StochasticDiffEq's SDE and RODE solvers control jump-state copying themselves, through
the `alias_jumps` field of their alias specifier. When it is unspecified they reuse the
jump state on thread 1 and copy it on other threads. To request a copy explicitly:

```julia
using StochasticDiffEq
sol = solve(sde_jprob, SRIW1(); alias = SciMLBase.SDEAliasSpecifier(alias_jumps = false))
```

The guidance above still applies: do not rely on these copies to make shared problems
safe for concurrent use.

## Reproducibility with `SortingDirect`

[`SortingDirect`](@ref) learns a search order for the jumps during a solve and keeps it
for later solves of the same problem (including remade problems), which speeds up many
consecutive simulations. Sampling remains exact, but a given seed reproduces a
trajectory only from the same learned order. To replay a simulation exactly, start from
a copy of a problem that has never been solved:

```@example reuse
sd_jprob = JumpProblem(dprob, SortingDirect(), maj; save_positions = (false, false))
fresh = deepcopy(sd_jprob)  # never solved
replay(seed) = solve(deepcopy(fresh), SSAStepper(); seed).u
replay(42) == replay(42)
```

Seeded ensembles using `SortingDirect` are also affected: exact replay requires the same
starting learned order, seeds, `batch_size`, thread count, and ensemble algorithm, and
serial and threaded runs generally give different trajectories.
